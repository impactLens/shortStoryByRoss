# THE UTOPIAN LIFT

## THE SURVIVAL PROB

The hot crushed stones from meteor shower is breaking the first invisible glass shield of the region. The harmonic noise broke everyone's dreaming cognition. Panic spreads in all the eyes and words. The navigation and guardian satellite up-link are preparing for the bunker capsules to shift all the species except the guards and the frontier mechanical machines mounted by the order of the region and district of councils. The wolves are howling in the nearest reservoir forest lake. They smell fear and fresh meat. They love it most as the queen usually feed them those who does not meet her requirement to stay in her regime. 

The noiseless shield is just activated. The stones breaking sound waves are fighting loudly outside. To norm the crowd the augmented memories of script are playing in the member's community screen. After couple hours, the probability of survival score are uproar from 15%. 

It's dark and orange at outside. “They are safe, let them circulate to the hemispheric safe-house authorization”, commands the queen to her beast shell shocked dogs and hounds. All of a sudden, the rectangular shaped Whitehorse capsules are ready in series or parallel queues and stack of lines. 

“All stand by”, the vocal of navigation pods says. Each house floor becoming a tray leaving all others as they are. Rest of the house premises are careful scanned and analysed to make the living being life is space comfortable. It's a memoir for them if they want to experience this later or their status quo or make thing de facto. 

The tray shape plates moved in the moment to the capsules by their citizen score. Though it's controversial, but the queen managed to mine the top-notch idea to reality to adjust the social and family in her economic adversity followed by diversity. There goes the monitored score. The wolves knew the taste who were in those steering committee. 

## NOT ALL IT IS WHAT IT SEEMED BY THE PLAIN VISUAL

The cracking sound of woods teases the thin air. All are genetically upgraded so that they can feed everyone and in odds serves to the region. The roots extending as far as they can go using the meteor heat and light along with their photosynthesis. From the top its look like forks stuck on the wet mud. The beast diesel engines are just starting to uproot the trees to make a lake to get the region underwater to perform the transactions and next commands given by the knights.

The temperature becoming hot and humid. The air is also getting thick but promising to all the fellows by the meantime. Nearly soon after midnight, the region goes underwater. “It's look like array of glittering lights from the top”, says the large screen of the control park. All the birds in those trees are in the air. Those are not living birds, they are mechanical machines and equipped with sensors to collect data in continuous and aggressive nature of the region. Tiny is the next saving of all life in the eyes of collaborative white seagull birds.

All are up above the air by now. The transportation still on hold though for careful thoughts of the queen & her allies. The next projected shields are up and running. As soon as it covers the region, the underwater world about to begin towards the safe region: the space. 

## WELCOME ABOARD
All were drowned in the large waves of water. The Queen release, therefore, the bishops who were proportional to their contributions to the society and their popularity & images, to drive the upper stream citizens to the outer space. A place to save her legacy in version control mood. As soon as the rooks opens the portal in hemisphere, the pods linked to the soundPort to travel. The thousands light blinking like countdown. All dark now and everything seems blank space while the lights are returned before the clock tick. The next pods are ready state by the by.

“The first transaction of transportation seems octagonal shape octopus surfing the cold gravitational space”, says the bishops who are seeing this first time. The eyes are for the citizens. They are allocated by their commutative score, family extension, sur name and health & employment establishment in the hive of each eye. The sensors releases their comfortable levels to breathe and in the background it is creating continuously their most likely version of the region in virtual reality. All are wake up now. “You all are watching live the ageless boundaries of your thoughts and intellects my dear fellow members of the premium bodies”, waves the voice like soprano the queen from the region. Everything except the citizens were aware by the cosmic jokes and the turmoil. They are trying to conclude that, but the system is leaving them in doubt always. Except their transportation, workplace and premises all the sustainability standard is quite different but completely scripted by the rival synthetic mind and body analyst: the wheel in the shape of distributive flying legs unless otherwise queens supervisor command. Nobody cares much as they are getting busy to live by their living in the expensive era of their status quo.

In space the clock is different from the region. In the region, the soundPort continuously shifting behavior and color to transport the citizens in the seamlessly synchronize and collective nature. The kids in the eyes says, “look something is winking at us”. They only are in conscious state, but nobody believes them thinking they are living currently in the eye.

## THE NEXT TICKLE

All the citizens by now destined by their safe spaces in abroad. The distribution is carefully allocated by the superPosition White Reindeer. Only fellows that left is the councils, belated and beloved person's preserved bodies, the intelligent machines, facilities, the administration and the guards from all species. 

The search ( squirrels and medWolf  )  of stubborn citizens ( they are surrounded by their philosophical ego to stay in the region ) are about to begin. The whole region exist are locked by the thin lights in hemisphere that cut every inch of anything that pass through it. The entire transportation facilities are transformed into capsules and preparing for the diverse community of leftover citizens by their belief. Each capsules are like flying vehicles without wings but similar like jet engines waiting for the squirrels to fill out blank space. Before the clock hours touches the next digit, the capsules are filled in in lines and it's propulsion system run immediately towards regions in which they can exercise their philosophical thoughts and belief. But, it's far far away from the region. The passage of their transportation was completely undersea level. Then they parabolic to bypass the large fire and meteor. 

The whole region under orange light alert. It is breaking and cracking the shield that once gave confidence to all meant to be unbreakable. The lake has started drying by the excessive heat and hypersonic waves of sounds. All power is out as shortages of energy. The tinkers request the queen to authorize the gravitational access of the core to utilize the energy supply to transport the whole region, the prime mothership which was millions miles underground splitting in the shape of bubbles. The councils of advisors, workers, machines, risk, contingency and logistics have cumulative 95% agree by the tinkers survey of survival concluding proportion. As soon as each community touches the score, without justified the energyPortal beginning to access by the mothership. The bubbles are becoming like electric features which are starting to travel to the hemisphere and act like a authorization pearls. 

The Queen, fellows and her legacy are remaining in the region. She posted response to all other realms to save her region from extinction. The crush meteor is the sign of the reply by her allies workforce. “We tried and got it out over your region. But, more and much more towards you now”, replied all her allies. 

“It's time”, says her Humanoids. All mothership clusters are closing all exit and waiting for the queen's clusters near outside hemisphere. The light of the star is the only source to control the flushing meteor shower. The ships from all allies using this from millions miles coverage surrounding the region. Only hope of beacon is the Queen's core engine's to utilize the star's energy near 100%. 

The whole region is a blank gray ashes fog disk. Everything is so quiet but completely noiseless. No living species or machines are their now. The dead turned dusted to eternity. The eyes looks like flushing lights. The capsules glittering like gold. The friends are shinning like white reddish shade of tone. 

No words left to describe the ecosystem and environment.
